Align Outline

Basically start with two strings
first substr - remove a character from the beginning of the second string
second substr - remove a character from both strings
third substr - remove a character from the first string

then recursively call the function on the remaining characters of each string
once you get to the last character of each string base cases will be called

base cases:
    both strings empty:
        in this case, return a generic align result with no character and a zero 
        score
    
    one string empty:
        return an align result with a -5 * number of characters in other string
        score, and a string consiting of number of s's or t's left over

now, after recusion:
need to add score values to first, second, and third substrings for each answer
also need to add character to each substring answer

now let answer equal the answer with the lowest score

notes:
at the beginning of the function, it will check if the configuration is in
the saved checks and return that score.

for every new configuration, at the end of each iteration the function will
save the configuration and score
